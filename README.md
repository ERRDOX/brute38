BIP38 brute force password cracker, written in Go

Based on Charlie Hothersall-Thomas' implementation, but rewritten front-end and expanded 
with more command-line options and better support for variable-length passwords. 

See Charlie Hothersall-Thomas' original implementation at: https://github.com/chigley/bip38

Requires:

- Go to be installed

Installation/Compilation:

> go get

> go build

Running:

> ./brute38

The above assumes you have Go set up properly and you copied the code into your GOPATH/src somewhere.
